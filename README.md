   REACT_APP_AI_API_URL=your_api_url
   REACT_APP_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

### Adding New Topics

To add new quiz topics, update the `TOPICS` array in `src/screens/TopicSelection.tsx`:

```typescript
const TOPICS = [
  // ... existing topics
  {
    id: 'YourTopic',
    title: 'Your Topic',
    description: 'Description of your topic',
