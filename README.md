- ðŸ¤– **AI-Generated Questions**: Dynamic question generation using AI services
- ðŸ“Š **Interactive Quiz**: Navigate through questions with progress tracking
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive design with smooth animations
- ðŸ“± **Mobile-First**: Optimized for all device sizes
- ðŸŽ‰ **Personalized Feedback**: AI-generated feedback based on your performance
- ðŸ“ˆ **Detailed Results**: Complete breakdown of your quiz performance

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Context API** for state management
- **CSS3** with modern features (Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties)

## Implementation Notes

### Prompts Used and Refinements

Questions prompt (sent to AI):

```text
Generate 5 multiple-choice questions about <TOPIC>.
Return ONLY JSON in this format:
[
  {
    "question": "string",
    "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
    "answer": "correct_option_text"
  }
]
```

Feedback prompt (sent to AI):

```text
Generate a personalized, encouraging feedback message for a quiz score of <SCORE>/<TOTAL> (<PERCENTAGE>%) in <TOPIC>.
The feedback should be motivational and specific to the topic. Keep it concise but engaging.
Return ONLY JSON in this format:
{
  "feedback": "Your personalized feedback message here"
}
```

Refinements and safeguards:
- The AI response is cleaned to remove code fences and then parsed via `utils/parseAIResponse.ts`.
- Strict structure validation; if malformed, a controlled error is returned and a retry mechanism is used (`retryWithFallback`).
- If retries still fail (e.g., CORS/network), a local fallback provides deterministic questions and feedback so the app remains usable.

- `components/`: Pure, reusable UI elements (`Button`, `Loader`, `ProgressBar`, `QuestionCard`).
- `screens/`: Feature-level pages orchestrating UI and behavior (`TopicSelection`, `QuizScreen`, `ResultScreen`).
- `context/QuizContext.tsx`: Centralized app state (topic, questions, answers, score, loading, feedback). Context was chosen over Redux/Zustand due to the small surface area, simple data flow, and need for cross-screen access without prop drilling.
- `services/aiService.ts`: Boundary to the AI provider (Gemini). Encapsulates request/response, retries, and fallbacks.
- `utils/parseAIResponse.ts`: Parsing, validation, and retry utilities to enforce JSON-only contracts from AI.
- `App.tsx`: Minimal step-based navigation (topic -> quiz -> result) driven by state, avoiding router overhead.

State choices:
- Answers stored as `Record<number, string>` keyed by question index for O(1) updates.
- `currentIndex` controls navigation and progress; derived progress avoids duplicate state.
- `isLoading` lives in context so screens/components can reflect global loading states consistently.


### Known Issues and Potential Improvements

Known issues:
- Calling Gemini directly from the browser can hit CORS or expose the API key. A thin backend proxy is recommended for production.
- AI responses can still occasionally deviate from spec; we mitigate with parsing and fallbacks, but a schema-based validator (e.g., Zod) would be stronger.
- The progress and navigation assume a fixed set of 5 MCQs; dynamic counts are supported but lightly tested.

Potential improvements:
- Add a small Node/Express proxy with server-side API key storage and rate limiting.
- Strengthen validation with Zod schemas and richer error reporting.
- Persist quiz attempts to `localStorage` and/or an API for history and analytics.
- Shuffle options per question and randomize question order with a stable seed.
- Add accessibility enhancements (roving tabindex for options, ARIA live regions for feedback).
- Add unit tests for `utils` and integration tests for screen flows.
- Internationalization (i18n) and right-to-left (RTL) layout support.
- Theme switch (light/dark) and configurable color tokens.
